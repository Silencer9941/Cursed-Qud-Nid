Changed I've made to the base game:
//V 0.1
  1. Bite-type Natural Weapons cause 1-3 bleed damage on hit
  2. Animals All come with Lv.5 Adrenal Control: Animals are feral and not afraid to fight you if needed in real life
  3. NPCs all come with Lv.3 Adrenal Control: Picking a fight with someone might be more difficult now
  4. Added mobile fungi, with new sprites, that spawn alongside normal fungi in their biomes
  5. Added a natural weapon to the new mobile fungi
  6. Saad Amus can now Teleport at Lv.1, and bleeds Lava (may change to acid)
  7. Saad Amus Clones can now teleport Lv.1
  8. Regular Crocs new come with Axe Expertise and Dismember, and can submerge. Similar to Sultan Crocs
  9. Sultan Crocs can now Berserk
  10. Salt Krakens are faster
  11. Natural weapons have an 8% chance to Disarm you on hit
  12. Metamorphic Polygel effectively removed from the game
  13. Dromads bleed lava and are immune to heat. Don't pick that fight or allow them to fight if you value these guys. Merchants are not forever.
  14. Snapjaws all have the Dismember skill and Throwing skill. Finally a fear to fight.
  15. New Snapjaws added to the population where you would normally find them. Amalgamations are more of a boss fight so they don't spawn in big numbers
  16. Baboons no longer throw rocks. They come with grenades now.
  17. Added a few different types of snapjaw: sparky, infected, grenadier, amalgamation
  18. Added a new Radpole: A gamma moth got ahold of a Madpole and did nasty things to it
  19. Radpole added to locations you would normally encounter a Madpole
  20. Red Jells have a new hidden mutation: Lava Glands
  21. Goatfolk Yurtwardens and Issachari Riflers no longer drop their items. Find a new way to make money.
  22. Astral Tabbies are now Phasing, not Astrally-bound. Their natural weapons do not dismember 75% of the time anymore however
  23. Bloated Pearlfrog and Svardym Hatchlings can spawn sometimes in the Salt Marsh now. Big risk, big reward.
//V 0.1.1
  24. Merchant stock does not respawn (possibly. requires testing)
//V 0.1.2
  25. Added mutating effect to Irisdual Beams, Glowmoths, Crungles, and gamma moth mutating happens much faster
  26.
